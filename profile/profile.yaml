# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a recent graduate from Conestoga College where I studied Software Engineering Technology. I am excited to be challenged by new technologies and expand my skillset as I have learned a variety of programming languages during the duration of my program. During my time at Conestoga College, I learned about web development, mobile development, relational databases, object-oriented programming, and assembly language. My interest in software engineering started in high school where I pursued many computer science and computer engineering courses. I am intrigued by all aspects of software engineering whether it be frontend, backend, or working with a database directly. Currently I am working as a software developer/data engineer at Jarvis to improve my skills by learning about core Java programming, design patterns, Maven, and agile development."

      - "Twitter App: In-progress"
      - "JDBC App: Developed an application that uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to insert and perform CRUD operations on data stored in a Docker-hosted PostgreSQL database. This project uses JDBC, PSQL, Maven, Docker, DAO, and DTOs."
      - "Grep App: Implemented an application to simulate the grep command available within Linux operating systems. This app was developed using Java, Maven, and Docker. The grep app allows a user to specify a regex, root directory, and output file. The files found within the root directory and any subsequent subdirectories are read then the retrieved lines are compared to the defined regex pattern. If the line matches the regex, it is then written to the output file."
